Mike used to try to gain love and acceptance by following the rules.

Then when he went to an InterPlay retreat, he noticed that the other
participants brought something else to their lives. They were allowing
themselves to be guided by their bodies. Now when he leads InterPlay forms, he
seeks to create an environment that allows participants to have whatever
experience their bodies want or need to have at that moment.
