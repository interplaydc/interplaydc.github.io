As a recovering serious person, I consider InterPlay my 12-step program and my
life practice for having more ease and grace. I've been InterPlaying for 27
years and have watched the blooming and spread of InterPlay all over the world
with gratefulness and delight.

For the past 13 years I've been immersed in the development and growth of the
Leader Training Program and currently serve as the program coordinator. I love
offering people the "big body" tools of InterPlay for telling their stories,
especially people on the margins of our communities. I am also passionate about
embodied spirituality, engaging people in prayer and worship forms that include
and honor the body. It has been an amazing experience to participate in and
teach InterPlay in many places around the world.

Currently the Leader Training Program is being reshaped to integrate Racial
Equity and Transformation into all aspects of InterPlay leader training. This is
truly an exciting and exhilerating time to be part of the world-wide community
of InterPlay!
