As a recovering serious person, I consider InterPlay my 12-step program and my
life practice for having more ease and grace.

I’ve been InterPlaying for 30+ years and have taken part in the blooming and
spread of InterPlay all over the world with gratefulness and delight. I love
offering people the body-wise tools of InterPlay and seeing them embody their
stories with fullness and grace.

Co-leader of North Carolina Untensive retreats, the DC Women’s Retreat, and
performance events. I organize international retreats and am currently
collaborating on a potential InterPlay adventure to France.

**Locale:** Raleigh NC
