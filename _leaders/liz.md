InterPlay is a growing influence in my way of showing up in the world.

It has informed the ways I teach art, organize and lead. I am also inspired to bring InterPlay to the wider community through my volunteer work. My volunteer work includes working with elders with cognitive disabilities at Iona Senior Center and at Smith Center and the Healing Arts, which provides support for people affected by cancer.

Liz Lescault, a visual artist and sculptor, has practiced, exhibited, and taught art for over 40 years.
Liz founded the DC Open Gathering and continues to coordinate the Open Gathering for the DC regionâ€™s InterPlay community. Liz is also a member of the DC InterPlay Organizing Body.
