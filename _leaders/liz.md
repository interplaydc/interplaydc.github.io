InterPlay is a growing influence in my way of showing up in the world.

It has informed the ways I teach art, organize and lead. I am also inspired to
bring InterPlay to the wider community through my volunteer work. My volunteer
work includes working with elders with cognitive disabilities at Iona Senior
Center and at Smith Center and the Healing Arts, which provides support for
people affected by cancer.

Liz Lescault, a visual artist and sculptor.
