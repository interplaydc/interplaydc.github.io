Kate Amoss, MA, LCPC, is an InterPlay Teacher and Professional Counselor
in private practice.
Trained in archetypal depth psychology, she has an abiding curiosity in all
things hidden below surfaces -- deep roots, bedrock truths, neuro-biological
processes, and ancestral antecedents. For her, InterPlay has offered the best
toolbox of forms and practices with which to excavate the mysteries of ourselves
and our world.
She has decades of experience leading workshops, performances, and mentoring
other InterPlayers. She co-founded The Big Yes Performance Group and co-led the
InterPlay Life Practice Program in Washington DC.
