Monisha Mittal is a **Certified Leader (CL)** and
**Life Practice Program Leader (LPL)** in the Washington DC region.

Since 2018, InterPlay and a regular Dance Chapel practice has been an integral
part of her Being and Becoming.
She proudly served as a Dance Chaplain for four years since the pandemic which
turned her into a poetry addict and spawned her Poetic Revelations writing
series (now named: The (tiny) Voice of Big Love).
Now a Somatic Coach and Play Architect, she holds sacred space for others to
tune into their Body Wisdom in one-on-one sessions, classes, and courses through
her Center for Somatic Leadership and Communication.
She is grateful to InterPlay for awakening her authenticity, for the exponential
connection and laughter its given her, and for supporting her daily recovery as
a recovering overachiever.
