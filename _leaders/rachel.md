Rachel is the founder and director of movement-theater company Racoco
Productions
(<a href="https://www.Racoco.org" target="_blank">Racoco.org</a>),
which fuses objects and materials (like pinatas, dough, taffy, chewing gum,
clay, paper, wood, and metal) with quixotic choreography and inventive
improvisation. She believes even Serious Art can make you laugh, and that
inviting laughter can open the door to engaging more comfortably with art, and
life.
