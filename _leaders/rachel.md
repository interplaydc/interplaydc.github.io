Rachel is the founder and director of movement-theater company Racoco
Productions (www.racoco.org), which fuses objects and materials (like pinatas,
dough, taffy, chewing gum, clay, paper, wood, and metal) with quixotic
choreography and inventive improvisation. She believes even Serious Art can make
you laugh, and that inviting laughter can open the door to engaging more
comfortably with art, and life.
