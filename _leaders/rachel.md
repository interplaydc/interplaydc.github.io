Since designing her own concentration, "Performance as Communication", at
Harvard University, she has continued to carve her own path, fusing raw
materials with absurdist visuals, quixotic choreography, and inventive
improvisation. In 2003, she founded performance company Racoco Productions.
Rachel has been Harvard's Clifton Visiting Artist, a Field Dance Fund Fellowship
awardee, and a Women in Motion commissioned artist. She has developed projects
for diverse audiences and environments, in NYC including Symphony Space, World
Financial Center, Incubator Art Space, Creedmore Psychiatric Center, Slipper
Room, and Socrates Sculpture Park, and in New Mexico, Maryland, France, England,
Czechia, Poland, India, and Vietnam. Projects have explored dough, clay, taffy,
gum, paper, wood, dirt, and metal and featured pinatas, air dancers, vacuum
cleaners, bathrobes, apples, a cotton candy machine, and 25 oversized flower
pots.
