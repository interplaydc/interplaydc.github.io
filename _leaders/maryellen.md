Maryellen has been dancing all of her life. She enjoys daily walks with the
family dog (Bowie) and shares an office with a cat named Smokey. When Maryellen
bumped into InterPlay in 2018, she believed that she had found a piece of her
puzzle. Over the last five years, she has had the privilege of experiencing
InterPlay with people from all over the world, both in person and on Zoom. She
became a certified leader in 2021 and now hosts a monthly in person playgroup in
her hometown of Bloomington, Indiana (which is also the hometown of the 
fantastic Phil Porter!)
