Love has many definitions: A strong affection for another arising out of kinship
or personal ties, Attraction based on sexual desire, Affection based on
admiration, To cherish, To like or desire actively, To thrive in. Whether a noun
or a verb, love is the most natural and complicated thing in the world. What
better way to address it than through play? Join me as we sing, dance, tell
stories, witness, notice, and reflect. We will be playing with self-love, love
of others, love of nature and a higher power. I invite you to bring a journal,
as there will be time for writing/drawing.
