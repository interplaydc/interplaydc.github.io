<h3>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT / Covid Testing:</h3>

After the October Open Gathering 3 people tested positive for Covid within a
few days of the gathering.  __As a result we are asking that participants take
a rapid test the day before or the morning of the gathering.__

We will have a few rapid tests available at the gathering if you forgot to test
but please don't rely on our supply, as the number of tests will be limited.

Thanks so much for your understanding and cooperation.
