**Attention: For those new to InterPlay**

The Open Gathering starts promptly at 10 am and breaks for lunch at 12:30 pm.
The morning and the first 45 minutes of the afternoon are led by a number of
different certified leaders, who often introduce a theme for the day. From 2:
00 - 2:45 pm, after the lunch break, InterPlay forms are led until 2:45pm. Then
at 2:45 until close at 4 pm we have ‘Offerings”, where anyone can make an
offering whether it be an InterPlay form or something else. Offerings is an open
format where the participants determine the content. Offerings can be forms with
multiple participants, a personal story, a poem, or an experience the individual
would like to share.

The person who proposes an offering must be a part of it.

Participants are "at choice" whether to contribute or may simply witness the
entire time.

The offering time is oriented more toward experienced InterPlayers, so newcomers
may wish to wait until they have experienced a few InterPlay gatherings before
coming to the Offerings. However, participants who are newer to Interplay may be
inspired by the wide variety of offerings, play-ideas and improvisational
scenarios that more experienced InterPlayers may bring up.

Newcomers are encouraged and invited to experience the essence of play that each
Open Gathering explores!
