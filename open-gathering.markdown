**Attention:  For those new to InterPlay**

The Open Gathering starts promptly at 10 am and breaks for lunch at 12:30 pm.
The morning, and the first 45 minutes of the afternoon, are led by one or more
certified leaders, who introduce a theme for the day. We currently have 12
certified leaders in the metro area, who volunteer to lead the Open Gathering at
various times. The organization and facilitating of the Open Gathering is all
accomplished by dedicated volunteers. We have various expenses including rent,
covered by the fees paid by attendees for the day.

From 2:00 - 2:45 pm, after the lunch break, InterPlay forms are led continuing
the theme of the day. Then at 2:45 until close at 4 pm we have **"Offerings‚Äù**,
where anyone can make an offering whether it be an InterPlay form or something
else. Offerings is an open format where the participants determine the content.
Offerings can be forms with multiple participants, a personal story, a poem, or
an experience the individual would like to share. The person who proposes an
offering must be a part of it.

Participants are "at choice" as to whether to contribute or may simply witness
the entire time.

The offering time is oriented more toward experienced InterPlayers, so newcomers
may wish to wait until they have experienced a few InterPlay gatherings before
coming to the Offerings.  However, participants who are newer to InterPlay may
be inspired by the wide variety of offerings, play-ideas and improvisational
scenarios that more experienced InterPlayers may bring up.

Newcomers are encouraged and invited to experience the essence of play that each
Open Gathering explores!
