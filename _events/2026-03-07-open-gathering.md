Before lunch they split the leading with a gentle intro to some Action Theater
forms and after lunch Rachel leads us in sister modality Action Theater for two
hours. No Body Spirit Celebration in the afternoon. As always join us all day,
or just morning, or just afternoon.

You can sample Rachel's Action Theater work on Tuesdays from 6:30pm to 7:45pm
before or after she comes by emailing her at <rachelcohen@racoco.org>.
Rachel will be leading 3 hours of Action Theater in Cabin John MD on Sunday for
those that want more.

Doug says of Action Theater it is like the next step after InterPlay.
A potentially deeper dive into the wisdom of the body.

Dana says "After doing Action Theater I feel present and awake!"
