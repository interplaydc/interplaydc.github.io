"The InterPlay of Love: from Self to Agape"

Love has many definitions: A strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties, Attraction based on sexual desire, Affection based on admiration, To cherish, To like or desire actively, To thrive in. Whether a noun or a verb, love is the most natural and complicated thing in the world. What better way to address it than through play? Join me as we sing, dance, tell stories, witness, notice, and reflect. We will be playing with self-love, love of others, love of nature and a higher power. I invite you to bring a journal, as there will be time for writing/drawing.
