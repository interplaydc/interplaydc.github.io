**InterPlay is an active, creative way to unlock the wisdom of the body for
everyone and every body.**

<img src="/assets/images/About.jpg" style="float: right" width="400">

**InterPlay** celebrates the creativity in every one of us and reminds us to
play and embrace life, expand our personal awareness, and discover our full
potential. InterPlay encourages new ways to communicate and tell your own
story. Leaders guide group participants through a series of playful
storytelling, movement, and sound exercises in incremental steps.

Each person decides how much or how little to do based on their own comfort
level.<br>
No previous experience required.

**InterPlay** is a community of people around the world who speak the shared
language of body wisdom, creativity, and play. InterPlay practices help build
communities and relationships that live and flourish in everyday life.
