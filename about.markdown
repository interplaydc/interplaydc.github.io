**InterPlay is an active, creative way to unlock the wisdom of the body for
everyone and every body.**

*“Twenty-two years ago I found InterPlay. And it was exciting and scary because
of the invitation to just be myself, be applauded and affirmed and also to learn
how there is wisdom inside my body that I can pay attention to and to be in the
heart of a community of people playing, laughing, crying, telling their stories,
taking the stuff of our lives which is hard, and sometimes creating art with
it.” — Ginny Going*

InterPlay brings play into our lives and reminds us that moving our bodies and
telling our personal stories reconnects us to joy and self-discovery. As we
embrace our creative expression, we develop our inner authority. We actively
experience play through noticing, witnessing, stillness, movement, storytelling,
and vocalization. At its foundation, InterPlay fosters a generosity of spirit,
and we practice seeing the best in others.

As children, we took every chance to be playful.  We had no fear of judgment
about our curiosity and inventiveness. As we age we stick with what we are
comfortable with and what we think is appropriate. Play reduces stress and helps
us access subtle thoughts and emotions, so it is a cathartic means of
self-exploration.  By applying the principles of non-judgment and refraining
from the pursuit of perfection, we enjoy the process rather than the product and
embrace our imagination.

Each person chooses how much or how little to take part in based on their own
comfort level.
